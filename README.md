# BDD for Jupyter Notebooks

This is a Hackday project at the [SSI Collaborations Workshop
2020](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw20).

This is a Python-based command-line tool for parsing
[Gherkin code](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) in Markdown cells
in a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook and generating skeleton unit
tests which are then inserted into the Notebook at the appropriate points.
